SegoPlayer is a PWA (Progressive Web App) that plays audio files (like songs and music) on your browser from your local storage and OFFLINE, you can click the add audio buttona to select one or multiple audio files and you can also select an image to make it the default background of your player to customize it to your taste

SegoPlayer is free and open source, I know the code is not optimized to the best so work is still in progress, the javascript code can be shortened or made simpler and I will work on this

Highlight : Sego is a Syriac Aramaic word ܣܶܓܳܐ (western Syriac to be more precise considering the pronunciation of the 'o' at the end of the word) which means 'Sunflower' which symbolizes hope and happiness 💛☀️🌻
